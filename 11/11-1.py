# If the stone is engraved with a number that has an even number of digits, 
# it is replaced by two stones. 
# The left half of the digits are engraved on the new left stone, 
# and the right half of the digits are engraved on the new right stone. 
# (The new numbers don't keep extra leading zeroes: 1000 would become stones 10 and 0.)
 
# If none of the other rules apply, 
# the stone is replaced by a new stone; 
# the old stone's number multiplied by 2024 is engraved on the new stone.
